Hello, my name is Raleigh Page, and I am a Junior at Eden Prairie High School. I've been taking CS classes since my Freshman year starting with AP Computer Science Principles, and continuing into my Sophomore year with AP Java. I love learning more about programming and in my iOS Development class I've learned a lot about developing something real and tangible. Below is a portfolio with all of the apps I've worked on during my time in the class.
