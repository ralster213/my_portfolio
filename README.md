# my_portfolio
Hello, my name is Raleigh Page, and I am a Junior at UW-Madison. 
I've taken CS classes since 9th grade starting with AP Computer Science Principles, and continued into my Sophomore year with AP Java. I love learning as much about programming as I can, and especially collaborating with other developers more experienced than myself. In my Junior year iOS Development class, I learned a lot about developing focused applications with clear objectives while dealing with a deadline. I also used github for the first time with a team, handling multiple branches and even using regular git through the Mac terminal to manually commit, push, and manage my projects. Cyber Security was my last CS course at EPHS, but certainly not the least. When compared to my previous CS courses, Cyber Security dealt more with the broader world of CS, including the many tribulations that come with developing for a valuable codebase. 
I've just completed COMP SCI 400 here at Madison which focused on Object-Oriented Design, Data Structures, and Algorithm Analysis. It's much different from high school - adjusting to a more focused self learning environment has been a blast.
Below is a portfolio with some of the apps I worked on.
